## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-20

### 🚀 Major Features

- **Loom Studio**: A complete visual development platform including `loom.studio` (Web UI) and `loom.visualization` (CLI & HTTP Tracers).
- **Native MCP Support**: Implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing seamless integration with external tool servers (`loom.tools.mcp`).
- **Concurrency Safety**: Completely refactored `AgentExecutor` to support thread-safe parallel execution by isolating state into `RunContext`.

### ✨ Enhancements

- Added `rich` based CLI visualization handler.
- Added `fastapi` and `uvicorn` support for the Studio server.
- Improved dependency management with optional extras (`studio`).
- Enhanced `AgentEvent` system to support visualization needs.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed a critical race condition in `AgentExecutor` where recursion depth and stats were stored in instance attributes, causing issues in parallel execution modes.
