# Roadmap

Based on our design philosophy, here is the future evolution of Loom:

## Short Term (v0.3 - v0.4)
- [ ] **Loom Studio (Visual Debugger)**: Visualizing the invisible self-organization process.
- [ ] **Distributed Hardening**: Providing out-of-the-box Redis/NATS Transport implementations.

## Mid Term (v0.5 - v1.0)
- [ ] **Fractal Runtime**: Supporting dynamic code generation and hot-reloading, allowing Agents to write and run their own Tools.
- [ ] **Multimodal Memory**: Extending Metabolic Memory to image and audio domains.

## Long Term (v2.0+)
- [ ] **Self-Evolving Swarm**: Agent clusters capable of automatically splitting, merging, and growing based on task difficulty.
- [ ] **Universal Agent Protocol**: Achieving interoperability across frameworks (Loom ↔ AutoGen ↔ LangGraph).
