# Loom Documentation

Welcome to Loom.

## The Long Horizon Challenge

Most agents fail not because they lack intelligence, but because they lack **structure that survives time**.

Loom is a **Long Horizon Agents Framework**—designed for AI agents that must remain coherent across dozens of steps, changing goals, and extended execution periods. When tasks span hours or days, intelligence alone isn't enough. You need structure.

> Intelligence solves problems. Structure survives time.

Read our [Manifesto](../MANIFESTO.md) to understand the philosophy behind Loom.

This documentation takes you from the "Why" to the "How".

## 1. The Goal (Why?)

Before writing a line of code, understand why Loom exists.

*   **[The Long Horizon Problem](concepts/axiomatic-framework.md#part-0-teleological-goal)**: Agents collapse when tasks get long. Plans expire, context explodes, memory fragments.
*   **[The Solution](README.md#)**: Fractal Architecture (structure that scales) and Metabolic Memory (identity that persists).

## 2. The Laws (Axioms)

The system is built on 5 immutable laws. Understanding them explains every design decision.

*   **[Axiomatic Framework](concepts/axiomatic-framework.md)**: The mathematical foundation of the system.

## 3. The Engine (Framework)

How the machine works under the hood.

*   **[Fractal Architecture](framework/fractal-architecture.md)**: How Loom solves "Spatial Entropy" through infinite recursion.
*   **[Context Management](framework/context-management.md)**: Intelligent context building and token optimization.
*   **[The Event Nervous System](framework/event-bus.md)**: How agents communicate (Axiom 2).

## 4. The Capabilities (Features)

What the agents can actually *do*.

*   **[Memory System](features/memory-system.md)**: Four-layer hierarchical memory (L1-L4) with automatic promotion and compression.
*   **[External Knowledge Base](features/external-knowledge-base.md)**: Integrate domain knowledge from multiple sources.
*   **[Search & Retrieval](features/search-and-retrieval.md)**: Semantic search across memory layers using embeddings.
*   **[Tool System](features/tool-system.md)**: Interacting with the outside world (Axiom 6).
*   **[Orchestration](features/orchestration.md)**: Patterns for Delegation, Routing, and Crew collaboration (Axiom 5).

## 5. The Manual (Usage)

Ready to build? Start here.

*   **[Getting Started](usage/getting-started.md)**: Build your first agent in 5 minutes.
*   **[API Reference](usage/api-reference.md)**: Comprehensive guide to the SDK (Levels 1-4).

## 6. Pattern Language

Recurring solutions to common problems.

*   **[Solving Complexity](patterns/solving-complexity.md)**: How to break down "Impossible Tasks".
