# Loom Documentation

Welcome to Loom.

Loom is a framework for building **Cognitive Organisms**—AI agents that can scale to infinite complexity and duration.

This documentation is structured to take you from the "Why" to the "How".

## 1. The Goal (Why?)

Before writing a line of code, understand why Loom exists.

*   **[Context](concepts/axiomatic-framework.md#part-0-teleological-goal)**: We are hitting the "Cognitive Entropy" wall.
*   **[The Solution](README.md#)**: Fractal Architecture (for Complexity) and Metabolic Memory (for Time).

## 2. The Laws (Axioms)

The system is built on 5 immutable laws. Understanding them explains every design decision.

*   **[Axiomatic Framework](concepts/axiomatic-framework.md)**: The mathematical foundation of the system.

## 3. The Engine (Framework)

How the machine works under the hood.

*   **[Fractal Architecture](framework/fractal-architecture.md)**: How Loom solves "Spatial Entropy" through infinite recursion.
*   **[Context Management](framework/context-management.md)**: Intelligent context building and token optimization.
*   **[The Event Nervous System](framework/event-bus.md)**: How agents communicate (Axiom 2).

## 4. The Capabilities (Features)

What the agents can actually *do*.

*   **[Memory System](features/memory-system.md)**: Four-layer hierarchical memory (L1-L4) with automatic promotion and compression.
*   **[External Knowledge Base](features/external-knowledge-base.md)**: Integrate domain knowledge from multiple sources.
*   **[Search & Retrieval](features/search-and-retrieval.md)**: Semantic search across memory layers using embeddings.
*   **[Tool System](features/tool-system.md)**: Interacting with the outside world (Axiom 6).
*   **[Orchestration](features/orchestration.md)**: Patterns for Delegation, Routing, and Crew collaboration (Axiom 5).

## 5. The Manual (Usage)

Ready to build? Start here.

*   **[Getting Started](usage/getting-started.md)**: Build your first agent in 5 minutes.
*   **[API Reference](usage/api-reference.md)**: Comprehensive guide to the SDK (Levels 1-4).

## 6. Pattern Language

Recurring solutions to common problems.

*   **[Solving Complexity](patterns/solving-complexity.md)**: How to break down "Impossible Tasks".
