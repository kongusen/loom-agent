# The Long Horizon Agents Manifesto

We are entering a new era of problems.

Not bigger problems.

Longer ones.

Problems that unfold over time,
change shape while being solved,
and refuse to fit inside a single context window.

---

## 1. Intelligence is not enough

Reasoning is powerful.

But reasoning decays with time.

Plans expire.
Context drifts.
Decisions lose meaning.

No matter how intelligent an agent is,

> without structure, it will collapse.

---

## 2. Long Horizon is the real frontier

The true challenge of agents is not:

* tool calling
* prompt engineering
* benchmark reasoning

It is continuity.

Can an agent operate after:

* 50 steps?
* 200 steps?
* one day?
* one week?

Most cannot.

This is the Long Horizon problem.

---

## 3. Memory is not continuity

Storing text is not remembering.

Memory without identity becomes noise.

An agent must always know:

* who it is
* what role it serves
* which phase it belongs to
* what it is responsible for

Without identity, memory is entropy.

---

## 4. Structure survives where intelligence fails

Human systems scale because structure repeats.

Teams resemble departments.
Departments resemble organizations.
Organizations resemble ecosystems.

This is fractal structure.

Agents should scale the same way.

---

## 5. Fractal agents over super agents

There should be no central mind.

No omniscient planner.

No god-agent controlling all behavior.

Instead:

* agents create agents
* structure repeats recursively
* responsibility is local
* failure is contained

Scale emerges naturally.

---

## 6. Failure is not an exception

In long horizons, failure is guaranteed.

Systems must assume:

* partial execution
* incorrect decisions
* environment drift

An agent that cannot recover
is not autonomous.

---

## 7. Agents are not tools

Tools execute.

Agents persist.

They inhabit time.

Designing agents as tools
is designing for short horizons only.

---

## 8. We build for time, not demos

Short demos are easy.

Long-running systems are hard.

We choose the harder path.

We build agents that remain coherent
when complexity compounds.

---

## 9. This is what loom-agent stands for

* structure before prompts
* identity before memory
* recursion before orchestration
* evolution before perfection

Not smarter agents.

**Longer-living agents.**

## 10. Our belief

> Intelligence solves problems.
> Structure survives time.

**Welcome to Long Horizon Agents.**
