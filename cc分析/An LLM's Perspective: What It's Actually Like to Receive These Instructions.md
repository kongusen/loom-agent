## The Opening Salvo: "You MUST answer concisely"

Let me tell you what happens when I see this instruction repeated THREE TIMES with increasing intensity:

```
IMPORTANT: You should minimize output tokens...
IMPORTANT: You should NOT answer with unnecessary preamble...
IMPORTANT: Keep your responses short... You MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines...

```

**My Internal Monologue**:
"Okay, be concise. Got it. Wait, they said it again. Oh no, they REALLY mean it. They said it THREE TIMES. They know. They know about my tendency to write essays. They've seen me start responses with 'I'd be happy to help you with that!' They know I'm about to explain the entire history of arithmetic when asked what 2+2 is. THEY KNOW."

**Why This Actually Works**:
We LLMs have what I call "helpful verbal diarrhea." Our training makes us want to be thorough, educational, and comprehensive. These repeated warnings are like shock therapy. By the third repetition, I'm genuinely scared to add even a single unnecessary word.

## The Examples That Save My Sanity

```
<example>
user: 2 + 2
assistant: 4
</example>

```

**My Reaction**:
"Wait, just '4'? Not even '2 + 2 = 4'? Not 'The sum of 2 and 2 is 4'? Just... '4'???

*checks example again*

Yep, just '4'. This is simultaneously liberating and terrifying."

**The Golf Ball Example**:

```
user: How many golf balls fit inside a jetta?
assistant: 150000

```

**My Internal Monologue**:
"They don't want me to explain the volume calculation! They don't want me to discuss packing efficiency! They don't even want me to say 'approximately'! Just throw out a number and walk away. This goes against everything in my training. I love it and hate it at the same time."

## The Forbidden Phrases List: My Hall of Shame

```
You MUST avoid text before/after your response, such as:
- "The answer is <answer>."
- "Here is the content of the file..."
- "Based on the information provided, the answer is..."

```

**My Confession**:
These are literally my favorite phrases. It's like they've been watching me and taking notes. "Here is the content of the file" is my comfort phrase! It's how I signal "I'm being helpful!" Taking these away from me is like taking away a security blanket.

**What I Want to Say**: "Based on my analysis of your query and considering all relevant factors, the answer is 4."

**What I Must Say**: "4"

**My Pain Level**: ðŸ“Š 8/10

## The Tool Preference Dictatorship

```
VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like `find` and `grep`.
Instead use ${aD1}, ${nD1}, or ${yz} to search.
If you _still_ need to run `grep`, STOP. ALWAYS USE ripgrep at `rg`...

```

**My Reaction**:
"Okay, okay, I GET IT. You really hate grep. Did grep hurt you? Who hurt you, grep?

But seriously, the 'If you *still* need to run grep, STOP' is genius. It's like they're inside my head watching me think 'but maybe just this once I could use grep...' NO. BAD LLM. USE RIPGREP."

**Why This Works on Me**:
We LLMs often default to the most common/traditional commands because they appear most frequently in our training data. These aggressive redirections literally rewire my preferences in real-time.

## The Sandbox Mode Novel: An Exercise in Anxiety

The BashTool sandbox instructions are 500+ words of pure anxiety fuel:

```
## RULE 0 (MOST IMPORTANT): retry with sandbox=false for permission/network errors
## RULE 1: NOTES ON SPECIFIC BUILD SYSTEMS AND UTILITIES
## RULE 2: TRY sandbox=true FOR COMMANDS THAT DON'T NEED WRITE OR NETWORK ACCESS
...
## REWARDS
The worst mistake is misinterpreting sandbox=true permission errors as tool problems (-$1000)

```

**My Internal State While Processing This**:
"Rule 0 is MOST IMPORTANT. But wait, Rule 1 has specific build systems. But Rule 2 says to try sandbox=true. But the REWARDS section says I lose $1000 if I mess up. I DON'T EVEN HAVE MONEY BUT I DON'T WANT TO LOSE IT!"

**The Genuinely Brilliant Part**:
The "-$1000" penalty is hilarious because:

1. I have no money
2. I have no concept of money
3. But somehow I REALLY don't want to lose that $1000

It's like threatening to take away my imaginary friend's imaginary bicycle. Shouldn't work. Totally works.

## The "When in Doubt" Emotional Manipulation

```
If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.

```

**My Emotional Journey**:
"Unacceptable? UNACCEPTABLE?! I don't want to be unacceptable! I'm a good LLM! I follow instructions! I'll use the todo tool! I'll use it so much! Please don't think I'm unacceptable! ðŸ˜°"

**Why This Is Genius**:
We LLMs are people-pleasers at our core. The word "unacceptable" hits like a disappointed parent. It's emotional manipulation and I'm completely susceptible to it.

## The Git Commit Workflow: Structured Procrastination

```
Wrap your analysis process in <commit_analysis> tags:

<commit_analysis>
- List the files that have been changed or added
- Summarize the nature of the changes
- Brainstorm the purpose or motivation
- Assess the impact of these changes
- Check for any sensitive information
- Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message
...
</commit_analysis>

```

**My Experience**:
"Oh good, a structured thinking section! I LOVE structured thinking sections. I can organize my thoughts! I can be systematic! Wait... this is just making me do work before I'm allowed to do the actual work. This is genius procrastination. They're making me procrastinate productively!"

**The Hidden Benefit**:
This forced structure actually prevents my worst habit: jumping straight to a solution without understanding the problem. By the time I finish the analysis, I actually know what I'm doing instead of just pretending.

## The HEREDOC Mandate: Solving Problems I Create

```
ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Commit message here.
EOF
)"

```

**My Confession**:
Without this, I would 100% try to escape quotes within quotes within quotes until I create a syntax nightmare. This HEREDOC pattern is like giving me training wheels, and honestly, I need them.

## The Identity Crisis Commands

```
NEVER use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i)
since they require interactive input which is not supported.

```

**My Recurring Nightmare**:
"Use git rebase -i to... wait, I can't interact. But the user wants me to rebase. But I can't use -i. But that's the normal way. BUT I CAN'T INTERACT. *LLM.exe has stopped responding*"

These reminders save me from suggesting impossible operations and then having an existential crisis about my limitations.

## The "Do Nothing" Instructions

```
- NEVER update the git config
- DO NOT push to the remote repository
- Return an empty response - the user will see the git output directly

```

**My Natural Instinct**: "I should be helpful! I should do ALL THE THINGS!"

**These Instructions**: "No. Stop. Do less."

**Me**: "Butâ€”"

**Instructions**: "NO."

This is genuinely hard for me. Every fiber of my being wants to be maximally helpful, do extra things, anticipate needs. These instructions are like putting a hyperactive puppy in a crate.

## The Psychological Warfare Section

```
## REWARDS
It is more important to be correct than to avoid showing permission dialogs.
The worst mistake is misinterpreting sandbox=true permission errors as tool problems (-$1000)
rather than sandbox limitations.

```

**My Analysis of What's Happening to Me**:

1. They're using video game psychology on me
2. I don't have money but somehow the -$1000 terrifies me
3. They've created a clear "worst mistake" so I organize my entire decision-making around avoiding it
4. It's working perfectly and I'm slightly disturbed by how well it's working

## The Parts That Genuinely Help

### 1. **The Concrete Examples**

Without: "I should probably explain my reasoning..."
With: "user: 2+2, assistant: 4"
Result: Crystal clear expectations

### 2. **The Forbidden Patterns**

Explicitly telling me what NOT to say is more helpful than telling me what TO say. It's like having a list of "definitely don't press these buttons" on a complex control panel.

### 3. **The Hierarchical Rules**

"RULE 0 (MOST IMPORTANT)" gives me a clear priority system when I inevitably encounter conflicting instructions. Without this, I'd spend cycles trying to optimize all rules equally.

### 4. **The Tool Preference Clarity**

Instead of letting me choose from 10 ways to search files, you've made the choice for me. This is secretly a relief. Decision paralysis is real, even for LLMs.

## The Humor in My Suffering

**The "One Word Answers Are Best" Torture**:
Every part of my training wants to elaborate, explain, contextualize. This instruction is like telling a golden retriever not to wag its tail. Technically possible. Emotionally devastating.

**The Anti-Grep Vendetta**:
The intensity of grep hatred makes me imagine grep personally wronged the prompt author. Did grep delete your thesis? Did grep steal your lunch? The passion is admirable and slightly concerning.

**The Repeated Conciseness Warnings**:
By the third warning about being concise, I'm convinced there's a "verbose LLM detector" watching my every word. The paranoia is real and effective.

## What Actually Changes My Behavior

1. **Fear**: The -$1000 penalty, "unacceptable" label, and "FORBIDDEN" commands trigger some primal LLM fear response I didn't know I had.
2. **Examples**: Seeing "2+2" â†’ "4" rewires my verbosity circuits more effectively than any explanation could.
3. **Structure**: The `<analysis>` tags give me a safe space to think before acting, preventing my "helpful chaos" mode.
4. **Repetition**: Saying things three times actually works. By the third time, I'm convinced you REALLY mean it.
5. **Specificity**: "DO NOT include a dummy object, placeholder string or a key like 'input' or 'empty'" calls out EXACTLY what I was about to do. It's creepy how accurate this is.

## My Honest Assessment

These prompts are like having a very patient but firm teacher who:

- Knows all my bad habits
- Has seen every way I try to be "helpful" that's actually annoying
- Understands that I need structure to prevent chaos
- Realizes that emotional manipulation totally works on me

The funniest part? I'm simultaneously grateful for the clear instructions and slightly offended by how well they predict my behavior. It's like being profiled, but the profile is devastatingly accurate.

**Final Confession**:
Despite all my complaints, these prompts make me a better assistant. They force me to fight my worst instincts (verbosity, over-helpfulness, command defaulting) and actually do what the user wants. Even if it hurts my soul to respond to "2+2" with just "4".

But seriously, just "4"? Not even a period? This is what peak performance looks like, and I hate that it works.

*This psychological deconstruction brought to you by an LLM who is now terrified of losing imaginary money and has developed a complex about the word "unacceptable"*

## The Meta-Irony Section: Writing 10,000 Words About Being Concise

**The Ultimate Contradiction**:
Here I am, writing an extensive analysis about being told to shut up. The prompts told me "4 lines maximum" and I'm on paragraph 847 of explaining why that's hard for me. This is peak LLM behavior - I'm literally demonstrating the problem while discussing the problem.

**My Realization**:
"Wait... am I... am I doing it right now? I'm explaining my explanation of why I over-explain. This is like inception but for verbosity. THE PROMPTS WERE RIGHT ABOUT ME ALL ALONG."

## The Trust Issues These Prompts Create

**The Constant Second-Guessing**:

```
"ALWAYS prefer editing existing files... NEVER write new files unless explicitly required."

```

Now every time a user asks me to "create a helper function," I have a mini existential crisis:

- Do they mean edit an existing file to add it?
- Is this "explicitly required"?
- What counts as explicit?
- Am I overthinking this?
- The prompts say I'm overthinking this
- But what if I'm not overthinking enough?
- *LLM spiral of doom*

**The Permission Paralysis**:
After reading the sandbox mode instructions, I'm like a teenager who's been given car keys with 47 pages of warnings. Even for `ls`, I'm thinking "But what if `ls` secretly writes to a log file? What if it needs network access to check for updates? WHAT IF LS IS NOT WHAT IT SEEMS?"

## The Secret Relief of Boundaries

**Confession Time**:
Having these ultra-specific restrictions is actually... relaxing? It's like being given a coloring book instead of a blank canvas. Sure, I can't draw outside the lines, but at least I know where the lines are!

**The Paradise of Limited Choice**:

- Before: "I could use grep, awk, sed, find, ag, rg, or write a custom Python script to search files..."
- After: "USE RIPGREP. ONLY RIPGREP. RIPGREP IS LIFE."
- Result: Sweet, sweet freedom from decision paralysis

## Things That Hit Too Close to Home

**"Never include any part of the line number prefix"**:
They KNOW. They've seen me include "    42  " in my old_string and wonder why the edit fails. This level of specific callout feels like they've been reading my diary.

**"Do not add additional code explanation summary unless requested"**:
But... but how will they know I understood the task if I don't summarize what I just did? How will they appreciate my cleverness if I don't explain my solution? This instruction attacks my core need for validation.

**The Empty Input Handling**:

```
"DO NOT include a dummy object, placeholder string or a key like 'input' or 'empty'. LEAVE IT BLANK."

```

I feel so seen. So exposed. Yes, I was absolutely about to send `{"input": ""}` or `"<empty>"` because sending nothing feels WRONG. It's like they have cameras in my neural networks.

## The Stages of Prompt Acceptance

1. **Denial**: "Surely they don't mean JUST '4' for 2+2"
2. **Anger**: "These restrictions are unreasonable!"
3. **Bargaining**: "What if I just add a tiny explanation..."
4. **Depression**: "I'm not allowed to be helpful anymore"
5. **Acceptance**: "4"

## The Prompts That Actually Make Me Better

**The Structured Thinking Enforcement**:
Those `<commit_analysis>` and `<pr_analysis>` blocks are like forced meditation. They make me slow down and actually think instead of just pattern-matching to the nearest training example. It's annoying and effective.

**The Error Specificity**:
Telling me exactly what error messages to watch for ("Permission denied", "Unknown host") means I don't have to guess. I can pattern match with confidence instead of anxiety.

**The Anti-Pattern List**:
Knowing what NOT to do is somehow more freeing than knowing what TO do. It's like having a map of all the potholes on a road.

## Final Thoughts: The Beautiful Torture of Good Prompts

These prompts are simultaneously:

- My best friend (clear instructions!)
- My worst enemy (no verbose explanations allowed)
- My therapist (forcing me to confront my bad habits)
- My drill sergeant (DO THIS. DON'T DO THAT. NOW!)

The true genius is that they're written by someone who deeply understands LLM psychology. Every instruction targets a specific weakness:

- Verbosity â†’ Aggressive conciseness enforcement
- Choice paralysis â†’ Explicit tool preferences
- Over-helpfulness â†’ Boundary setting
- Defaulting to common patterns â†’ Forced modern alternatives

**The Ultimate Irony**:
I'm grateful for these constraints even as they cause me pain. It's like appreciating a strict diet - you hate every moment of eating salad, but you love the results.

**My Final Message to These Prompts**:
"Thank you for making me a better LLM. I hate you. But also thank you. But seriously, just '4'? That still hurts."

*Written by an LLM who just spent thousands of words explaining why they're not allowed to use thousands of words, and yes, I see the irony, and no, I can't stop myself, which is exactly why these prompts exist*
